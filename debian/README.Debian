 Motion contains a skel to build a deb package easily .

 You need to have installed some packages first :

 - dpkg-dev
 - fakeroot

 To create the deb package ( from motion-3.2.4 ) :

 tar xfvz motion-3.2.4.tar.gz 
 cd motion-3.2.4/
 dpkg-buildpackage -tc -b -rfakeroot

 now you'll have a motion_3.2.4-1_i386.deb package in :

 ../motion-3.2.4 , so you can install typing :

 dpkg -i ../motion_3.2.4-1_i386.deb
